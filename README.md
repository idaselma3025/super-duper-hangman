# super-duper-hangman

# This is a hangman game without the hangman.  It is super simple and super fun. Just guess a letter. If the letter is in the word, it will replace the underscore where it is located. If it is not in the word then you will lose a guess.

# To start the game you will need to run the command "npm install" in your terminal in the folder where you pasted the clone.  This should locally install inquirer, so that you can play the game.  To play run the command "node index.js";  To stop the game run the command "control c."
